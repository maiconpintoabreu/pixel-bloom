# Game Design Document: Aether Drift

## Game Concept Overview
Game Title: Aether Drift
Genre: Casual Arcade, Endless Runner (Top-Down)
Platform(s): Mobile (iOS, Android), Web (HTML5)
Target Audience: Casual gamers, ages 8+, looking for a relaxing yet engaging experience.

"Aether Drift" is a minimalist, top-down endless runner where players guide a small, ethereal ship through an ever-changing cosmic environment. The core objective is to survive as long as possible by avoiding obstacles and collecting "Aether Shards" to unlock cosmetic upgrades and new ship designs. The game emphasizes fluid movement, atmospheric visuals, and a calming ambient soundtrack, providing a meditative yet challenging experience.

## Core Gameplay Loop
Start Game: Player taps to begin a new run.

Drift & Avoid: The player's ship automatically moves forward. Players control horizontal movement (left/right) by tapping and holding on either side of the screen or by using tilt controls (optional).

Obstacles: Various cosmic debris (asteroids, energy fields, derelict structures) drift towards the player. Collision with an obstacle ends the run.

Collect Aether Shards: Small, glowing "Aether Shards" are scattered throughout the environment. Collecting them adds to the player's score and currency.

Power-ups (Minimal): Rare, temporary power-ups might appear, such as a brief shield or a magnetic pull for shards.

Dynamic Environment: The background and obstacle patterns subtly shift and evolve over time, increasing challenge and visual variety.

End Run: Upon collision, the game displays the score, collected shards, and offers options to restart or visit the shop.

Shop & Progression: Players use collected Aether Shards to unlock new ship skins, trail effects, and possibly different background themes.

## Art Style & Theme
Visuals:

Minimalist & Atmospheric: Clean lines, simple geometric shapes for obstacles and ships.
